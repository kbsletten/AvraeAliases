Manage hit dice.
**Getting Started**
Run `!level` or `!hd cc` to create the CCs for your character based on class and level. If you need to set this up manually, the command is `!cc create 'Hit Dice (d#)' -min 0 -max CLASS_LEVEL`.
**Using Hit Dice**
To use hit dice from the pool, simply run `!hd 1` (you can use more by using a larger number).
**Song of Rest/Additional Healing**
To add additional healing with your hit dice, run `!hd 1 -b 1d6`.
**Recovering Hit Dice**
When you take a long rest, run `!hd lr` to recover half of your hit dice (minimum of 1).
**Resetting Hit Dice**
To reset all of the counter, run `!hd max` to recover all of your hit dice.
